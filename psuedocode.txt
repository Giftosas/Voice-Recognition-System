What did I do?
- Broke the project into separate parts
    - Create the Database (Voice recognition)
    - Create tables (Users and Voice)
    - Wrote the code to enhance the audio
    - Wrote code to verify a single user
    - Wrote code to retrieve data from the database

What remains to do?
    - Combine everything on streamlit

How the web-app looks like:
    - Home page (Welcoming people to the site, and about the project and project team)
    - New User Registration (Collect info from users to train a new voice model)
    - Collect voice input page (from user, collect voice from user)
    - Redirect to the extract users page if user exists


You have a function that converts streamlit audio to blob
You have a function that converts uploaded audio to blob
Add both to db_creation file and call them when you need them.

DELETE TABLE AND START AGAIN FROM SCRATCH
